To the friends & family of 

Zelda Muffin Pants Cushinghamm
===============
TL;DR - our fluffy kitty might have cancer. 

She's having surgery on Wednesday, Feb. 11th to remove
and biopsy a couple marble-sized masses.

Community ask: as you can imagine, this has all been quite
difficult. If you're able, any emotional and/or financial
support would be massively appreciated

More info on the surgery:
===============

Our sweet elderly baby has developed a few cysts/masses: one
behind each ear (back of her mandible)and one on her belly. 


We don't know if they're malignant or not, but their rate of
growth and the fact that they've multiplied are concerning
factors, so it's probable. The only way to know for sure is to
biopsy, and if they're going to put her under and cut into these
lumps, they might as well remove them at the same time. 


Her surgery on Feb. 11th will remove two of the three growths,
because the vet doesn't want her under anesthesia too long.
Depending on the biopsy results, another surgery could be in her
future, or we might opt to let her be if the recovery from the first
procedure is too hard on her. 

There's a lot we won't know until after they are removed.

Halp! Zelda is 15 years old and has
had a full, adventurous, and storied
life, but I'm just not ready, and I don't
think she is, either. 

The last couple years have been very
tough, and all the while she's been my
one constant companion.

It's hard to ask for help and I'd
never want anyone to feel
obligated, but if you have any
extra nickels that you'd like to
donate to the cause, it would be
immensely helpful.


The surgery cost is $1,800-$2,200
